      These air fryer hot dogs in toasted buns turn out perfectly crisp in
      minutes with the help of your air fryer. Top with ketchup, mustard,
      relish, chili, or condiments of choice.

      In an air fryer preheated to 400 degrees F, four hot dogs should be

      crisp after about two minutes.
